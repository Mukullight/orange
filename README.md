# Data model 
### User Model
The `User` model extends Django's built-in `AbstractUser` model, which provides basic user functionalities like authentication and user management.

- **name**: A character field to store the user's name, with a maximum length of 200 characters. It can be null.
- **email**: An email field that must be unique for each user. It can be null.
- **bio**: A text field to store a biography or description of the user. It can be null.
- **avatar**: An image field to store the user's avatar. It defaults to "avatar.svg" if not provided. It can be null.
- **USERNAME_FIELD**: Specifies that the email field will be used for authentication instead of the default username.
- **REQUIRED_FIELDS**: Specifies that the username field is required when creating a user.

### Topic Model
The `Topic` model represents a category or subject that rooms can be associated with.

- **name**: A character field to store the name of the topic, with a maximum length of 200 characters.

### Room Model
The `Room` model represents a chat room or discussion forum.

- **host**: A foreign key to the `User` model, representing the user who created the room. If the host is deleted, the room's host will be set to null.
- **topic**: A foreign key to the `Topic` model, representing the topic associated with the room. If the topic is deleted, the room's topic will be set to null.
- **name**: A character field to store the name of the room, with a maximum length of 200 characters.
- **description**: A text field to store a description of the room. It can be null and blank.
- **participants**: A many-to-many field to the `User` model, representing the users who are participating in the room. It can be blank.
- **updated**: A datetime field that automatically updates to the current date and time whenever the room is updated.
- **created**: A datetime field that automatically sets to the current date and time when the room is created.
- **Meta**: Specifies that rooms should be ordered by the `updated` and `created` fields in descending order.

### Message Model
The `Message` model represents a message sent within a room.

- **user**: A foreign key to the `User` model, representing the user who sent the message. If the user is deleted, the message will also be deleted.
- **room**: A foreign key to the `Room` model, representing the room where the message was sent. If the room is deleted, the message will also be deleted.
- **body**: A text field to store the content of the message.
- **updated**: A datetime field that automatically updates to the current date and time whenever the message is updated.
- **created**: A datetime field that automatically sets to the current date and time when the message is created.
- **Meta**: Specifies that messages should be ordered by the `updated` and `created` fields in descending order.

### Relationships
- **User to Room**: A user can host multiple rooms and participate in multiple rooms.
- **Topic to Room**: A topic can be associated with multiple rooms.
- **User to Message**: A user can send multiple messages.
- **Room to Message**: A room can contain multiple messages.

This data model sets up a basic structure for a chat application where users can create and participate in rooms, and send messages within those rooms. The `Topic` model adds a layer of categorization to the rooms.
